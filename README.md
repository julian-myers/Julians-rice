CHA BOI's RICE and NVIM config

install neovim 

install gnome extensions via snap or apt

    in gnome extensions install "User-Themes", "Blur my Shell", "Astra Monitor", 
    "PaperWM"

    Under System Extensions in gnome extensions disable everything besides apps menu    
    PaperWM is kinda optional but it kinda sick too but it can be a pain to get 
    working well and configure so its not totally necessary.

Make sure you have an app called gnome tweaks: sudo apt install gnome-tweaks i 
believe

install alacritty and set as default terminal

install fish if not installed already (also kinda optional), but I think you ought 
to give it a try

install plank: sudo apt install plank (I believe)
    Make this a start up application.

Once this is done
    
    Go to gnome tweaks app and under 'appearance':
        
        change cursor to 'Bibata-Modern-Ice'
        change icons to 'Papirus'
        change Shell to 'Catppuccin-Orange-Dark'
        change legacy applications to 'Catppuccin-Orange-Dark'

You'll probably need to restart the computer.
